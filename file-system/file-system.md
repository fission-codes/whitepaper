# File System

The Fission File System \(FFS\) is an versioned, evented, security-forward file tree with an object-capability access model. At a high level:

* Public and private subtrees
* Cryptrees \(with symmetric keys\) to enable both security and sharing
* Event stream
* File metadata
* Tags & collections
* Searchable
* Automatic structured 
* Unstructured userspace
* Programmable
