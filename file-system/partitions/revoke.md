# Revoke

UCAN revocation is achieved via a [Certificate Revocation List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list) expressed as a grow-only prefix trie. It must contain both the revoked UCAN, and be signed by a DID in the proof chain above the target UCAN.

This lives at `/revoke/*`. For a UCAN to be valid, a validator must construct a proof of non-inclusion, in addition to the UCAN's internal structural checks. A revocation claim contains the following information:

```haskell
data RevocationClaim = RevocationClaim
  -- Links
  { revoke   :: HardLink UCAN -- UCAN to revoke
  , resolved :: HardLink UCAN -- Resolved revoked UCAN
  -- Metadata
  , revoker  :: DID       -- DID in proof chain
  , sig      :: Base64Url -- signRSA(didPK, revokedCID)
  }
  
type RevocationTable = Map (CidOf UCAN) RevocationClaim
```

The `revoke` and `resolved` may be the same. We rely on the content addressed hard links to de-deuplcate storage if they're identical. If the original revoked UCAN is Merkle compressed, dereference at least the parts that include the revoker's DID through to the genesis DID.
