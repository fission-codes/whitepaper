# QUAKE

QUAKE is a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) for "QUAKE: User Authentication & Key Exchange".

There are several ways to send this information securely, but here we will be solving for the most difficult and universal case: over pubsub. These messages are visible to the world in cleartext. We want to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of spoofing. While we have a list of known-good exchange keys in DNS \(and later right in the user's WNFS\), we would like to avoid hitting the network as much as possible. Luckily, we can bootstrap up a secure channel with a known ID on one side and a challenge nonce on the other.

It should be noted that the bootstrap process here may also be used to set up secure channels for other use cases, including chat.

## Sequence

### Summary

### **Step 1: Everyone Subscribes to Channel**

All parties listen for messages on a channel named for the root DID. A peer that can issue UCANs must be online and listening on the correct channel. For simplicity and future compatibility, it's the root DID in the UCAN chain being requested.

#### Example

üíª \(who has a UCAN already\) and üì± \(requestor\) listen for incoming messages on channel `did:key:zALICE`

### **Step 2: Requestor Broadcasts an Exchange Public Key**

This gives everyone on the channel a 2048-bit RSA public key to send private data to.

Note that this MAY be a throwaway public key as we \(and the WebCrypto API\) keep encryption keys separate from signing keys. It will be used to bootstrap up a channel but does not need to live beyond that \(though it can\). The ONLY requirement is that the public key be unique to this machine. \(The secret key MUST never be shared, and it is ideally non-exportable.\)

#### Example

üì± broadcasts the cleartext message `did:key:zTHROWAWAY` on the channel `did:key:zALICE`

### **3. Provider Opens Channel**

Since RSA-OAEP can only hold a small amount of data, we use it to open a secured channel.

{% hint style="danger" %}
At this step, we **do not** know that the provider is actually our other machine, and not a person-in-the-middle ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòà We will authenticate them in the next step.
{% endhint %}

The provider üíª sends an asymmetrically encrypted AES256 session key to the public key broadcast in step 2. The provider must ensure that they ONLY use this key for this one channel, aimed at the specific RSA public key received in step 2. New connections MUST use new randomly generated keys.

We will use this session key for the remainder of the steps.

### **4. Session Key Negotiation over UCAN**

This step is both a "preflight" and session key authentication. It delegates no rights \(`att = []`\) but includes the entire proof chain that will be used in the actual credential delegation \(step 4\). This proves _a priori_ that you are communicating _directly_ with an authorized machine. \(it can prove that it has access to the credentials you want to delegate\).

We then use this to embed the AES256 session key in the "facts" field. Since UCANs are signed, we can prove that this came from the authorized user. Because the entire payload is asymmetrically encrypted against the public key in the audience field, we know that no one else has been able to decrypt this message.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will tell us that the sender intended that key for us, and no others. It is predicated on the assumption that the **provider never reuses that key** in any other channel.
{% endhint %}

In short, this step proves provides two things:

1. Proves that you are talking to a machine that does, in fact, have the correct rights that you're looking to have delegated
2. Authenticates the 256-bit AES key to make sure that the session key hasn't been tampered with

üíª responds by broadcasting a "closed" UCAN on channel `did:key:zALICE`, encrypted with the session key. The embedded UCAN is proof that the sender does, in fact, have permissions for the account, but it does not delegate anything yet. The facts section \(`fct`\) includes the same session key that is used to encrypt the data on this channel.

```javascript
// A UCAN with sent to the THROWAWAY address with *no delegation*
closedUcan.claims.iss = `did:key:z${LAPTOP}`
closedUcan.claims.aud = `did:key:z${THROWAWAY}`
closedUcan.claims.fct = [..., {"sessionKey": sessonKeyAES256}]
closedUcan.claims.att = [] // i.e. MUST delegate nothing
closedUcan.claims.prf = [...proofs] // May be omited if on the root machine

closedUcan.signature = rsaSign({
  secretKey: LAPTOP_SK,
  tokenHead: closedUcan.header,
  tokenClaims: closedUcan.claims
})

// Encrypt the token
const encryptedPayload = rsaEncrypt({
  to: IPHONE_PK, 
  payload: closedUcan
})
```

Here we're _securely_ responding with a randomly generated AES256 key, embedded in the UCAN's "facts" section. Since UCANs are signed, and the audience is the recipient, we have proof this message was intended for the recipient and has not been modified along the way.

The recipient MUST validate the following:

1. The encrypted message can be decrypted by SK associated with the `ucan.aud`
2. Signature chain ‚Äî¬†from the outermost JWT signature, all the way through nested UCANs back to the root
3. The first-level proofs \(EXACTLY one level above\) MUST contain the permissions that you are looking to be granted \(not two nested levels of \`att: \[\]\`\), OR be the root credential.
4. The innermost \(root\) issuer \(`iss` field\) MUST match the channel's DID \(i.e. the DID that you are requesting from\).

{% hint style="danger" %}
If any of the above does not match, you MUST ignore that message and start again. It's Eve's machine trying to establish a person-in-the-middle attack \(PITM\) üòà
{% endhint %}

### **5. Confirm Requestor PIN**

Steps 1-3 establish a connection with _a requesting machine_, but not necessarily _the user's machine_. To validate that this is the correct user, we go out of band and have the human verify a code.

The requestor displays a challenge \(PIN code\) to the user. It sends the PIN¬†and DID/signing key \(encrypted with the AES key\) over pubsub. The UCAN holder decrypts and displays this PIN to the user and asks them to confirm that it matches. If it matches, you are talking to the correct machine, and you have the DID to delegate to üéâ

#### Example

üì± receives the above message and extracts the sender's DID \(and thus PK\). It then [verifies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/verify) that the sender's PK is in the list of exchange keys found in DNS for the target username.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If PIN validation fails, you MUST ignore the message. It's Eve trying to get you to delegate rights to her ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **You MUST start over, since that channel is compromised.**
{% endhint %}

### **6. Credential Delegation**

Now that we know that the message can be trusted, the token holder creates a UCAN with delegate rights for the requestor using their DID from the most recent message. Send that UCAN and the WNFS read key \(which is also an AES key\) back over the pubsub channel ‚Äî¬†of course, encrypted with the AES session key.

```javascript
aesEncrypt(
  key: sessionKey,
  payload: {
  "readKey": wnfsReadKey,
  "ucan": newUcan
})
```
