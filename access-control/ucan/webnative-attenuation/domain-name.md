# Domain Name

## Resource

The resource type is `"domain"`. The resource value is simply a domain name.

## Subdomains

Because the nature of domain names, having access to the apex confers access to subdomains, but not vice-versa.

## Capabilities

At the present time, the only capability supported by Fission is `"SUPER_USER"`

### SUPER\_USER

The ability to register and unregister domain names, set any DNS records, and so on.
