# Command & Mutation

Commands and mutations and relegated via capability endowment from the account that initially created the resource \(the ”root owner”\). This is a form of delegated acess, where an agent \(indexed by DID\) that has been granted certain capabilities may redelegate a subset to another agent.

## UCAN

Fission‘s protocol for this is called a User Controlled Authorization Network, or ”UCAN” \(pronounced ”you can”\). Let’s break that term down:

### User Controlled

Users control the data \(and other resources\) that they create. They also have the ability to delegate control to others.

### Authorization Network

Network here is pulling double duty as both ”graph” and ”transport”.
