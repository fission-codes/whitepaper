# Abstract

The past decade has seen a number of advances in distributed systems, decentralized technologies, open source collaboration, commons infrastructure, and new classes of software and data licenses. At the same time, development on cloud platforms has become increasingly complex, to the point of becoming its own subdiscipline. We are also in the midst of unprecedented cultural awareness of technology's impact on politics, control, public discourse, and personal safety.

To meet the technical and social needs of 2020, 2025, and beyond, we introduce Asimov: a web-scale, secure-by-default, where users own and control their identity and data, code is executable on any machine, and removes deployment as a separate development stage.

A major barrier to user adoption is unfamiliarity with advanced or novel paradeigms. As such, Asimov follows a philosophy of _progressive decentralization_.

* We propose a framework that bridges data storage, digital scarcity, and portable compute.
