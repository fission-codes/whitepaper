# Authentication

## DIDs

User authentication is provided by 

Fission IDs conform to the W3C DID spec, but only requires a message signed with the associated private key to authenticate.

> Motivation. There is a need for non updateable DID's for use in IOT and other applications, where lack of network, size of code base and other such concerns are paramount to adoption. These concerns need to be addressed while not lowering the overall security guarantees.

### Encoding

The base Edwards 25519 key is encoded in base64 for transmission and consistency.

### Method

Fission DIDs use the `nacl` DID method.

### Unique Key

Unlike other DID methods, a Fission Identity MUST contain _exactly one_ key. Fission treats identity as pseudonymous at best, and thus relegates access control to the realm of verifiable claims.

### Content Address

Since a Fission DID does not change, it may be referenced at a stable CID.

## Elliptic Curve Standard

Following [Postel's Law](https://lawsofux.com/postels-law), the Fission accepts any key signing scheme, but only generates keys on [Curve 25519](https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html), with signatures on the [Edwards Curve](http://cr.yp.to/newelliptic/newelliptic.html).

We have chosen Edwards 25519 for a multitude of reasons, not least of which being reasonable performance and quantum-resistant security.

> \[...\] concretely Curve25519 works with keys consisting of about 256 bits, while an equivalent RSA instantiation would need key sizes of 3072 bits long.

Elliptic curve cryptography is by no means "perfect security", and can be defeated if the verifier does not verify that the public key actually falls on the correct curve.

## DID Document

### Example Document

```javascript
{
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/did/v1',
  id: 'did:nacl:Md8JiMIwsapml_FtQ2ngnGftNP5UmVCAUuhnLyAsPxI',
  publicKey: [
    {
      id: `did:nacl:Md8JiMIwsapml_FtQ2ngnGftNP5UmVCAUuhnLyAsPxI#key1`,
      type: 'ED25519SignatureVerification',
      owner: 'did:nacl:Md8JiMIwsapml_FtQ2ngnGftNP5UmVCAUuhnLyAsPxI',
      publicKeyBase64: 'Md8JiMIwsapml_FtQ2ngnGftNP5UmVCAUuhnLyAsPxI'
    }
  ],
  authentication: [
    {
      type: 'ED25519SigningAuthentication',
      publicKey: `did:nacl:Md8JiMIwsapml_FtQ2ngnGftNP5UmVCAUuhnLyAsPxI#key1`
    }
  ]
}
```

## JWT Authentication

Fission uses the familiar JWT format, with a few extra keys.

### Signature Auth

Authentication method will be extensible in the future, ideally converging to the IETF's Signature method as that becomes a more mature standard. 

### Complete Example

```javascript
{
  "alg": "Ed25519",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
{ 
  "iss": "AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICpuH/fqCFLbAConChyVH6rZzSaxlnHSwQk6qvtPsf5E",
  "aud": "https://runfission.com",
  "sub": "/ipfs/Qm12345"
  "iat": 1529496683,
  "exp": 1575606941,
  "nonce": 
}
SIGNATURE





{
  header: { 
    typ: 'JWT',
    alg: 'EdDSA'

}
```

### Fields

#### Nonce

The signature MUST include a monotonically-increasing nonce.

The use of a nonce in conjunction with a timestamp ensures that a man-in-the-middle attack cannot do a fast-follow replay. Monotonically increasing nonces 

#### Timestamp

A request SHOULD include the following timestamps:

* `created`
* `expires`
